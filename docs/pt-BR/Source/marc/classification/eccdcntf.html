                  <p>Subfield $0 contains the system control number of the related authority record, or a standard identifier. These identifiers may be in the form of text or a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). If the identifier is text, the control number or identifier is preceded by the appropriate MARC Organization code (for a related authority record) or the Standard Identifier source code (for a standard identifier scheme), enclosed in parentheses. When the identifier is given in the form of a Web retrieval protocol, e.g., HTTP URI, no preceding parenthetical is used.</p>
                  <p>Subfield $0 may contain a URI that identifies a name or label for an entity. When dereferenced, the URI points to information describing that name. A URI that directly identifies the entity itself is contained in subfield $1.</p>

                  <p><strong>Field link type</strong> is separated from preceding data by a reverse slash “\”. It is a code indicating the reason for the link and it follows the link number, or sequence number if present. In the absence of a field link type, it is assumed that subfield $8 is used for linking and sequencing related 6XX (Notes) or 76X (number building instructions and subarrangements) fields. The use of subfield $8 to maintain the order of these fields is essential to the understanding and application of the subarrangement or table. The following one-character field link type codes have been defined for use in subfield $8: </p>
