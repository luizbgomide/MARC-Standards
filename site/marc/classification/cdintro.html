   <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <hr>
   <div class="formatname">MARC 21 Classification</div>
   <div class="datename">June 2021</div>
   <hr>
   <p>The five MARC 21 communication formats, <em><a href="../authority/index.htm">MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</a></em>, <em><a href="../bibliographic/index.htm">MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data</a></em>, <em><a href="../holdings/index.htm">MARC 21 Format for Holdings Data</a></em>, <em><a href="index.htm">MARC 21 Format for Classification Data</a></em>, and <em>
         <a href="../community/index.htm">MARC 21 Format for Community Information</a></em>, are widely used standards for the representation and exchange of bibliographic, authority, holdings, classification, and community information data in machine-readable form. </p>
   <p>A MARC record is composed of three elements: the record structure, the content designation, and the data content of the record. The <strong>record structure</strong> is an implementation of the international standard <em>Format for Information Exchange</em> (ISO 2709) and its American counterpart, <em>Bibliographic Information Interchange</em> (ANSI/NISO Z39.2). The <strong>content designation</strong>--the codes and conventions established explicitly to identify and further characterize the data elements within a record and to support the manipulation of that data--is defined by each of the MARC formats. The <strong>content</strong> of the data elements that comprise a MARC record is usually defined by standards outside the formats. Examples are the <em>Library of Congress Classification</em> (LCC), the <em>Dewey Decimal Classification</em> (DCC), and other classification schemes used by the organization that creates a record. The content of certain coded data elements is defined in the MARC formats (e.g., the Leader, field 00, subfield $w in the 4XX and 5XX tracing fields). </p>
   <p>The <em>MARC 21 Format for Classification Data: Including Guidelines for Content Designation</em> defines the codes and conventions (tags, indicators, subfield codes, and coded values) that identify the data elements in MARC classification records. This document is intended for the use of personnel involved in the creation and maintenance of classification records, in the publication of classification schemes from machine-readable data, as well as those involved in the design and maintenance of systems for the communication and processing of classification records. A section in the documentation entitled <strong>scheme-specific conventions</strong> describes coding practices for the two major classification schemes, the <em>Library of Congress Classification</em> and the <em>Dewey Decimal Classification</em>. </p>
   <p> Classification data may be used for online public catalog retrieval systems, online systems for library classifiers (e.g., for machine-assisted classification), systems for the maintenance and development of classification schedules, validation of classification numbers assigned to bibliographic records, and linking to MARC authority records. Wherever possible, classification data elements were designed to be generic, i.e., usable for any classification scheme. Data element features were designed to accommodate the two major classification schemes in use in the United States: <em>Dewey Decimal Classification</em> (DDC) and <em>Library of Congress Classification</em> (LCC). This documentation is also available online, including a concise version and a simple field list at: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">www.loc.gov/marc/</a>. </p>
   <hr>
   <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE CLASSIFICATION FORMAT</strong></p>
   <p>The <em>MARC 21 Format for Classification Data</em> is designed to be a carrier for information about classification numbers and captions associated with them. The source of the information is the classification scheme identified in field 084 (Classification Scheme and Edition), subfield $a (Classification scheme code). </p>
   <p><strong>Kinds of Classification Records</strong></p>
   <p> MARC classification records are distinguished from all other types of MARC records by the presence of code w (Classification data) in Leader/06, Type of record. The <em>MARC 21 Format for Classification Data</em> further identifies three kinds of classification records in 008/06, Kind of record: </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Schedule</strong> record &#8722; A classification data record in which field 153 (Classification Number) contains a classification number or span from the schedule itself, including a number which has been built from applying add instructions (008/06, code a) </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Table</strong> record &#8722; A classification data record in which field 153 contains a classification number or span from a table. Table numbers generally cannot stand alone and are intended to be added to a base number to form a synthesized classification number (008/06, code b) </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Index term</strong> record &#8722; A record in which the 1XX field contains a general explanatory term in field 154 (General Explanatory Index Term) that represents a concept that is not related to one classification number or span (008/06, code c) </li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Types of Numbers</strong></p>
   <p>The MARC classification record is an authority record for the classification number(s) and caption contained in field 153 (Classification Number). Classification numbers with captions may also appear in fields 453 (Invalid Number Tracing) and 553 (Valid Number Tracing). <strong>Index term only</strong> records contain an index term in field 154 (General Explanatory Index Term) instead of a classification number and caption in field 153. Three types of classification numbers are defined in the classification format and identified in 008/07 (Type of classification number): </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Single number</strong> - A single classification number is one classification number; the components of which may be contained in a single or repeatable subfield $a (Single number or beginning number of span) in a record. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Defined number span</strong> - A defined number span is a range of classification numbers with a beginning number contained in subfield $a and an ending number contained in subfield $c (Ending number of span). The numbers between the beginning and ending numbers are defined by a separate table or subarrangement. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Summary number span</strong> - A summary number span is also a range of classification numbers with a beginning and an ending number. The caption contained in subfield $j (Caption) summarizes a topic that is represented by the span in subfields $a and $c. A summary number span is not defined by a separate table or subarrangement; instead, the numbers falling within the span are generally defined separately by their own records. </li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Classification Number Usage in Bibliographic and Authority Records</strong></p>
   <p>MARC bibliographic records may contain classification numbers in fields 050-09X. MARC authority records may contain classification numbers in fields 053 (LC Classification Number) and 083 (Dewey Decimal Classification Number). Classification numbers may be valid, invalid or, in the case of a span, partially valid. A <strong>valid</strong> classification number may be used in a bibliographic or authority record by itself or with additional letters or numbers. In the case of a span, a portion of it may be used in a bibliographic record. In addition a number that has been synthesized by correctly applying a table, internal subarrangement or add instructions to a classification number or span is considered valid for use in a bibliographic or authority record; a classification record may or may not be created for synthesized numbers or numbers within spans. </p>
   <p>A <strong>partially valid</strong> classification number span is one in which only the beginning or ending number of a span is valid. Only the valid portion may be used in bibliographic or authority records. An <strong>invalid</strong> number may not be used in a bibliographic or authority record. However, a classification record may be created for an invalid number in cases where the reference information cannot be communicated by a simple 453 tracing because a more detailed reference note is required. Invalid numbers in a 153 field of an invalid record or in a 453 field (Invalid Number Tracing) may not be used in bibliographic or authority records. </p>
   <p><strong>Required Classification Data Fields</strong></p>
   <p>A classification data record should contain at a minimum the following fields:</p>
   <div class="table">
      <table>
         <tr>
            <td width="55" align="left" valign="top">008</td>

   <p><strong>COMPONENTS OF CLASSIFICATION RECORDS</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Description of Record Parts</strong></p>
   <p>A MARC classification record consists of three main components: the Leader, the Directory, and the Variable Fields. The following information summarizes the structure of a MARC record. More detail is provided in More detail is provided in <em><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/">MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media</a></em>. </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Leader</strong> - Data elements that provide information for the processing of the record. The data elements contain numbers or coded values and are identified by relative character position. The Leader is fixed in length at 24 character positions and is the first field of a MARC record. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Directory</strong> - A series of entries that contain the tag, length, and starting location of each variable field within a record. Each entry is 12 character positions in length. Directory entries for variable control fields appear first, sequenced by tag in increasing numerical order. Entries for variable data fields follow, arranged in ascending order according to the first character of the tag. The stored sequence of the variable data fields in a record does not necessarily correspond to the order of the corresponding Directory entries. Duplicate tags are distinguished only by the location of the respective fields within the record. The Directory ends with a field terminator character (ASCII 1E). </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Variable fields</strong> - The data in a MARC classification record is organized into <strong>variable fields</strong>, each identified by a three-character numeric tag that is stored in the Directory entry for the field. Each field ends with a field terminator character. The last variable field in a record ends with both a field terminator and a record terminator (ASCII 1D). </li>
   </ul>
   <p>There are two types of variable fields:</p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Variable control fields</strong> - The 00X fields. These fields are identified by a field tag in the Directory but they contain neither indicator positions nor subfield codes. The variable control fields are structurally different from the variable data fields. They may contain either a single data element or a series of fixed-length data elements identified by relative character position. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Variable data fields</strong> - The remaining variable fields defined in the format. In addition to being identified by a field tag in the Directory, variable data fields contain two <strong>indicator positions</strong> stored at the beginning of each field and a two-character <strong>subfield code</strong> preceding each data element within the field. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>The <strong>variable data fields</strong> are grouped into blocks according to the first character of the <strong>tag</strong>, which identifies the function of the data within the record. The type of information in the field is identified by the remainder of the tag. </p>
   <div class="table">
      <table>
         <tr>
            <td width="109" align="left" valign="top">0XX</td>

      </table>
   </div>
   <p>Within the 1XX, 4XX, 5XX blocks, certain parallels of content designation are usually preserved in the subfield coding. </p>
   <p>Within variable data fields, the following two kinds of content designation are used:</p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Indicator positions</strong> - The first two character positions in the variable data fields that contain values which interpret or supplement the data found in the field. Indicator values are interpreted independently, that is, meaning is not ascribed to the two indicators taken together. Indicator values may be a lowercase alphabetic or a numeric character. A blank (ASCII SPACE), represented in this document as a #, is used in an undefined indicator position. In a defined indicator position, a blank may be assigned a meaning, or may mean <em>no information provided</em>. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Subfield codes</strong> - Two characters that distinguish the data elements within a field which require separate manipulation. A subfield code consists of a delimiter (ASCII 1F hex), represented in this document as a $, followed by a data element identifier. Data element identifiers may be a lowercase alphabetic or a numeric character. Subfield codes are defined independently for each field; however, parallel meanings are preserved whenever possible (e.g., in the 153, 453, and 553 fields). Subfield codes are defined for purposes of identification, not arrangement. The order of subfields is generally specified by standards for the data content, such as the classification scheme itself. </li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Multiscript Classification Records</strong></p>
   <p>A MARC classification record may contain <em>data</em> in multiple scripts. One script may be considered the primary script of the <em>data content</em> of the record, even though other scripts are also used for data content. (Note: ASCII is used for the structure elements of the record, with most coded data also specified within the ASCII range of characters). General models for multiscript data are described in <a href="eccdmulti.html">Appendix C</a>, along with several full record examples. </p>
   <p><strong>Field and Subfield Repeatability</strong></p>
   <p>Theoretically, all fields and subfields may be repeated. The nature of the data, however, often precludes repetition. For example, a classification record may contain only one 1XX field. The repeatability or non-repeatability of each field and subfield is specified in the format. </p>
   <p><strong>Fill Character and Related Values</strong></p>
   <p>A fill character (ASCII 7C hex), represented in this document as a vertical bar (|), may be used in classification records in field 008, and in control subfield $w of the 453 and 553 fields (Invalid and valid Number Tracing). A fill character may not be used in the Leader, or in tags, indicators, or subfield codes. The use of the fill character in a classification record indicates that the format specifies a code to be used, but the creator of the record has decided not to attempt to supply a code. </p>
   <p> Code n (Not applicable) is defined in many coded positions to indicate that the characteristic defined by the position is not applicable to a specific type of number or kind of record. </p>
   <p><strong>Display Constants</strong></p>
   <p>A display constant is a term, phrase, spacing, or punctuation convention that may be system generated under prescribed circumstances in order to make a visual presentation of data in a record more meaningful to a user. In the classification format, certain field tags, subfield codes (e.g., subfields $c, $z), indicator values (e.g., field 684, Auxiliary Instruction Note, first indicator, type of note), and coded values (e.g., control subfield $w/0, Special relationship) may be used to generate specific terms, phrases, and/or spacing or punctuation conventions for the display of a record. The use of display constants is determined by each organization or system. Examples of display constants are provided under <em>Scheme-specific conventions</em> and <em>Input Conventions</em> in the field descriptions. </p>
   <p><strong>Record Content Responsibility</strong></p>
   <p>The <em>MARC 21 Format for Classification Data</em> serves as a vehicle for classification data of all types from any organization. In general, the responsibility for the data content, content designation, and transcription of data within a MARC record may be determined by examination of the field indicated in the <strong>responsible parties</strong> section below. </p>
   <p><strong>Responsible Parties</strong></p>
   <p>In <em>unmodified records</em>, the organization identified as the original cataloging source in 040 subfield $a is responsible for the content of the record. The organization identified as the transcribing agency in field 040 $c is responsible for the content designation and transcription of the data. </p>
   <p>Certain data elements are defined in relation to the authoritative agency that maintains the list or rules upon which the data is based (e.g., field 750, Index Term&#8722;Topical). An organization using an authoritative-agency data element must use the authoritative list or rules specified for the data element. These lists or rules are specifically identified in the data element descriptions. The responsibility for the content of the data element belongs to the organization identified in subfields $a and $d of field 040. </p>
   <p>Other data elements are defined in the format as being exclusively assigned by a single agency (e.g., field 010, Library of Congress Control Number). The content of agency-assigned elements is always the responsibility of the agency. The content designation and transcription of the data may be the responsibility of another organization identified in subfield $c of field 040. </p>

   <p><strong>ORGANIZATION OF THIS DOCUMENT</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Main Parts</strong></p>
   <p><em>MARC 21 Format for Classification Data</em> consists of a Summary Statement of Content Designators followed by a detailed presentation of each content designator. Following the descriptions of the Leader and the Directory, the variable control fields are arranged in field tag order (001-008). The variable data fields are presented in the following groupings in order to bring together fields that serve related functions: </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet">Numbers and Codes</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Classification Numbers and Terms</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Tracings and Reference Fields</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Note Fields</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Index Term Fields</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Number Building Fields</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Electronic Location and Access</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Appendixes to this document provide information about several control subfields (<a href="eccdcntf.html">Appendix A</a>), full level record examples (<a href="examples.html">Appendix B</a>), multiscript record examples (<a href="eccdmulti.html">Appendix C</a>), a glossary of terms used in the document (<a href="cdapndxd.html">Appendix D</a>), lists of changes to the format since the last edition or update (<a href="cdapndxe.html">Appendix E</a>), and a list of organization code sources (<a href="eccdorg.html">Appendix F</a>). </p>
   <p><strong>General Information Sections</strong></p>
   <p>To avoid repetition, general information sections are provided for groups of fields with similar characteristics. These general information sections provide instructions for the content designators that are common to each field in the group. The description for each of the fields refers back to the general information section for that group. </p>
   <p>A <em>X53 General Information</em> section is provided for Classification Numbers. This general information section provides instructions for the content designators that are common to classification numbers whether they are used in a 153 classification number field or in a 453 or 553 tracing field. The description for each of the classification number fields refers back to the X53 general information section. </p>
   <p>A <em>Tracing and Reference Fields&#8722;General Information</em> section describes the use of the various reference note fields and tracings in constructing displays of cross references from these fields. It also provides instructions for applying subfields $i, $t and $w in the 453 and 553 tracing fields. The description for each of the reference note fields contains the detailed instructions for the content designators for the field. The user is referred to the Tracing and Reference Fields General Information section only for cross reference display descriptions. The 453 and 553 descriptions refer to both the X53 and the Tracings and References General Information sections for content designator instructions. </p>
   <p>In addition, the format includes several general information sections to summarize blocks of fields. These are: 00X (Control Fields), 008 (Fixed-Length Data Elements), 1XX (Classification Numbers and Terms), 01X-08X (Numbers and Codes), 6XX (Note Fields), 70X-75X (Index Term Fields), and 76X (Number Building Fields). </p>
   <p><strong>Components of the Detailed Descriptions</strong></p>
   <p>A detailed description may consist of six parts: content designator listing; character position or field definition and scope; guidelines for applying content designators, with examples; input conventions; and content designator history. </p>
   <p>The <strong>content designator listing</strong> area presents </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet">the name of the content designator</li>
      <li class="nobullet">the repeatability/nonrepeatability code (R or NR)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>For the Leader and the variable control fields, the list gives the <strong>name</strong> of the character position and any defined coded value. For the variable data fields, the list gives the name of the indicator positions and any defined coded values and the name of the subfield codes and any defined coded values. For all variable fields, the <strong>repeatability/nonrepeatability code</strong> at the field level specifies whether the field may be repeated in a record. For variable data fields, the subfield repeatability code specifies whether the subfield code may be repeated within a field. </p>
   <p>The <strong>character position or field definition and scope</strong> area describes the contents of the character position or field, the appropriateness of its use in specific kinds of classification records, and gives other information, such as field repeatability in particular circumstances, the use of required lists or rules in formulating the data, etc. </p>
   <p>The <strong>guidelines for applying content designators</strong> area describes the content and scope of each coded value, indicator, or subfield code and gives other information, such as appropriateness for use and repeatability in certain circumstances. The coded values and subfield codes in this area are presented in alphabetical/numerical order. Examples showing the use of the content designator are provided immediately following the description. The examples illustrate the application of specific MARC content designation. The data may be fuller or less full than would be used in actual cataloging practice. In some cases, policy decisions will need to be made concerning the application of MARC content designation. In addition, further editing, articularly of the <em>LCC</em> schedules, may be necessary to encode the data beyond what was done in this document.. </p>
   <p>The <strong>scheme-specific conventions</strong> area describes inputting practice applicable only to specific classification schemes, as identified by the classification scheme code in field 084 (Classification Scheme and Edition). Examples include the equivalents of scheme-specific terminology in MARC, display constants, and input conventions only applicable to specific schemes. </p>
   <p>The <strong>input conventions</strong> area provides general guidance for the application of the content designators, and for such things as punctuation, spacing, and the use of display constants. </p>
   <p>The <strong>content designator history</strong> area provides a record of significant content designator changes. The types of changes that are included are: </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet">newly defined content designators that impact on coding consistency within a file </li>
      <li class="nobullet">redefined codes and values</li>
      <li class="nobullet">changes in codes and values for consistency across MARC specifications</li>
      <li class="nobullet">changes in repeatability when it impacts on file consistency</li>
      <li class="nobullet">restructuring</li>
      <li class="nobullet">obsolete content designation. Obsolete content designation formerly defined in only one format are designated <em>[USMARC only]</em> or <em>[CAN/MARC only]</em>; unmarked items were defined in both formats. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>In the MARC formats, a distinction is made between <strong>obsolete</strong> and <strong>deleted</strong> content designators. An <strong>obsolete</strong> content designator is one that may have been used in MARC records and that may continue to appear in records created prior to the date it was made obsolete. Obsolete content designators are not used in new records. An obsolete content designator is recorded in the <em>Content Designator History</em> area. Content designation instructions are provided for retrospective conversion of records having data elements that would have been identified by the obsolete content designator. A <strong>deleted</strong> content designator is not recorded in the history area and will no longer appear anywhere in the MARC documentation. A content designator that had been reserved in MARC but has not been defined, or one that had been defined but is known with near certainty not to have been used, may be deleted from the format. A deleted content designator is available for redefinition in a format. A deleted content designator is available for redefinition in a format. </p>
   <p><strong>Typographical Conventions</strong></p>
   <p>Throughout this document, the following typographical conventions are used:</p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet">0 - The graphic 0 represents the digit zero in tags, fixed-position character positions, indicator positions, and other places numerics are used. This character must be distinguished from an uppercase letter O in examples or text. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"># - The graphic symbol # is used for a blank in coded fields and in other special situations where the existence of the character blank might be ambiguous. (In most textual examples, the blank is represented in the conventional way, by the absence of a character.) </li>
      <li class="nobullet">$ - The graphic symbol $ is used for the delimiter portion of a subfield code. Within the text, subfield codes are referred to as <em>subfield $a</em>, for example. </li>
      <li class="nobullet">/ - Specific character positions of the Leader, Directory, field 008, and subfield $w are expressed using a slash and the number of the character position, e.g., Leader/06, $w/0. </li>
      <li class="nobullet">1 - The graphic 1 represents the digit one (hex 31). This character must be distinguished from a lowercase roman alphabet letter l (hex 6C) and uppercase alphabetic letter I (hex 4C) in examples or text. </li>
      <li class="nobullet">| - The graphic | represents a fill character in MARC examples. When this mark appears in the left margin, it indicates areas of the text of this document where changes have been made. </li>
   </ul>
