   <h3>FIELD DEFINITION AND SCOPE</h3>
   <div class="definition">
      <div>
         <p>Information needed to locate and access an electronic resource from a Web archive or a digital archive repository. This field may be used in a bibliographic record for a resource when that resource or a subset of it is stored in a Web archive or digital repository. The field may be used in addition to or in place of field 856 if it is desired to provide additional information about archived resources beyond what is possible in field 856. The field may also be used to provide location and access to a digitized archived version of a tangible resource, e.g., a book or CD-ROM described in the record, or a related archived resource. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
         <p>Field 857 is repeated when an electronic resource has been stored in more than one Web archive or digital archive repository. </p>
