These identifiers may be in the form of text or a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). If the identifier is text, the control number or identifier is preceded by the appropriate MARC Organization code (for a related authority record) or the Standard Identifier source code (for a standard identifier scheme), enclosed in parentheses.

The function of an <em>occurrence number</em> is to permit the matching of the associated fields (not to sequence the fields within the record). An <em>occurrence number</em> may be assigned at random for each set of associated fields. An <em>occurrence number</em> of less than two digits is right justified and the unused position contains a zero. </p>
