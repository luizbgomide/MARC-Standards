   <h3>FIELD DEFINITION AND SCOPE</h3>
   <div class="definition">
      <div>
         <p>Contains the information needed to locate and access electronic information pertaining to a community service such as the service or event website or related resources. Subfields $y (Link text) and $z (Public note) may be used to specify the type of electronic information. The phrase "networked electronic resource" is used to refer to an electronic resource for which content is accessed using a network protocol like telnet, http, ftp, etc.</p>
         <p>Field 856 is repeated when the location data elements vary (the URL in subfield $u or subfields $a and $d, when used). It is also repeated whenever the electronic filename varies (subfield $f), except when a single intellectual item is divided into different parts for online storage or retrieval.</p>
