                  <p>Subfield $0 contains the system control number of the related authority record, or a standard identifier. These identifiers may be in the form of text or a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). If the identifier is text, the control number or identifier is preceded by the appropriate MARC Organization code (for a related authority record) or the Standard Identifier source code (for a standard identifier scheme), enclosed in parentheses. When the identifier is given in the form of a Web retrieval protocol, e.g., HTTP URI, no preceding parenthetical is used. </p>
                  <p>Subfield $0 may contain a URI that identifies a name or label for an entity. When dereferenced, the URI points to information describing that name. A URI that directly identifies the entity itself is contained in subfield $1.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>Data that links fields that are different script representations of each other. Subfield $6 may contain the tag number of an associated field, an occurrence number, a code that identifies the first script encountered in a left-to-right scan of the field, and an indication that the orientation for a display of the field data is right-to-left. A regular (non-880) field may be linked to one or more 880 fields that all contain different script representations of the same data. Subfield $6 is structured as follows:</p>
                  <p>$6[linking tag]-[occurrence number]/[script identification code]/[field orientation code]</p>
                  <p>Subfield $6 is always the first subfield in the field.</p>
                  <p>Descriptions of multiscript record models, with examples, are in <em><a href="echdmulti.html">Multiscript Records</a></em>; specifications for field 880 are under that field; specifications for character sets and repertoires for scripts are found in <em><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/spechome.html">MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media</a></em>. </p>

                  <p><strong>Linking tag and occurrence number - </strong><em>Linking tag</em> part contains the tag number of the associated field and is always three characters in length. This part is followed immediately by a hyphen and the two-digit <em>occurrence number</em> part. A different occurrence number is assigned to each set of associated fields within a single record. The function of an <em>occurrence number</em> is to permit the matching of the associated fields (not to sequence the fields within the record). An <em>occurrence number</em> may be assigned at random for each set of associated fields. An <em>occurrence number</em> of less than two digits is right justified and the unused position contains a zero. </p>
                  <p>When there is no associated field to which a field 880 is linked, the <em>occurrence number</em> in subfield $6 is 00. It is used if an agency wants to separate scripts in a record (see <em><a href="echdmulti.html">Multiscript Records</a></em>). The <em>linking tag</em> part of subfield $6 will contain the tag that the associated regular field would have had if it had existed in the record. </p>

For a display of the field, the default field orientation is left-to-right. When the field contains text that has a right-to-left orientation, the <em>script identification code</em> is followed by a slash (/) and the field <em>orientation code</em>. The MARC field <em>orientation code</em> for right-to-left scripts is the letter r. The <em>orientation code</em> is only included in fields with right-to-left orientation, since left-to-right orientation is the default orientation in 880 fields. (See <em><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/spechome.html">MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media</a></em> for a detailed description of field orientation.) </p>

                  <p>Data that identifies linked fields and may also propose a sequence for the linked fields. Subfield $8 may be repeated to link a field to more than one other group of fields. The structure and syntax for the field link and sequence number subfield is:</p>

                  <p><strong>Linking number</strong> is the first data element in the subfield and required if the subfield is used. It is a variable-length whole number that occurs in subfield $8 in all fields that are to be linked. Fields with the same linking number are considered linked. </p>
                  <p><strong>Sequence number</strong> is separated from the linking number by a period "." and may be optional. It is a variable- length whole number that may be used to indicate the relative order for display of the linked fields (lower sequence numbers displaying before higher ones). If it is used it must occur in all $8 subfields containing the same linking number. </p>
                  <p><strong>Field link type</strong> is separated from preceding data by a reverse slash “\”. It is a code indicating the reason for the link and it follows the link number or sequence number if present. In the absence of a field link type, it is assumed that subfield $8 is used for linking and sequencing 85X, 86X, or 87X fields (captions, enumeration and chronology, textual holdings, and/or item information). Subfield $8 is essential to link and order these fields. </p>
