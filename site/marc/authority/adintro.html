   <hr>
   <p>The five MARC 21 communication formats, <em><a href="../bibliographic/index.html">MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data</a></em>, <em><a href="ecadhome.html">MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</a></em>, <em><a href="../holdings/echdhome.html">MARC 21 Format for Holdings Data</a></em>, <em><a href="../classification/eccdhome.html">MARC 21 Format for Classification Data</a></em>, and <em><a href="../community/eccihome.html">MARC 21 Format for Community Information</a></em>, are widely used standards for the representation and exchange of bibliographic, authority, holdings, classification, and community information data in machine-readable form. </p>
   <p>A MARC record is composed of three elements: the record structure, the content designation, and the data content of the record. The <strong>record structure</strong> is an implementation of the international standard <em>Format for Information Exchange</em> (ISO 2709) and its American counterpart, <em>Bibliographic Information Interchange</em> (ANSI/NISO Z39.2). The <strong>content designation</strong>--the codes and conventions established explicitly to identify and further characterize the data elements within a record and to support the manipulation of that data--is defined by each of the MARC formats. The <strong>content</strong> of the data elements that comprise a MARC record is usually defined by standards outside the formats. Examples are the <em>International Standard Bibliographic Description</em> (ISBD), <em>Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules</em>, <em>Library of Congress Subject Headings</em> (LCSH), or other cataloging rules, subject thesauri, and classification schedules used by the organization that creates a record. The content of certain coded data elements is defined in the MARC formats (e.g., the Leader, field 008). </p>
   <p> The <em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data: Including Guidelines for Content Designation</em> defines the codes and conventions (tags, indicators, subfield codes, and coded values that identify the data elements in MARC authority records). This document is intended for the use of personnel involved in the creation and maintenance of authority records, as well as those involved in the design and maintenance of systems for communication and processing of bibliographic records. This documentation is also available online, including a concise version and a simple field list at: <a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/">www.loc.gov/marc/</a>. </p>

   <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE AUTHORITY FORMAT</strong></p>
   <p>The <em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</em> is designed to be a carrier for information concerning the authorized forms of names, subjects, and subject subdivisions to be used in constructing access points in MARC records, the forms of these names, subjects, and subject subdivisions that should be used as references to the authorized forms, and the interrelationships among these forms. A <strong>name</strong> may be used as a main, added, series, or subject access entry. </p>
   <p>The term <strong>name</strong> refers to: </p>
   <div class="table">
      <table>
         <tr>
            <td width="209" align="left" valign="top">personal names (X00)</td>
            <td width="388" align="left" valign="top">names of jurisdictions (X51)</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td valign="top" align="left">corporate names (X10)</td>
            <td valign="top" align="left">uniform titles (X30)</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td valign="top" align="left">meeting names (X11)</td>
            <td valign="top" align="left">name/title combinations</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </div>
   <p>The term <strong>subject</strong> refers to: </p>
   <div class="table">
      <table width="610">
         <tr>
            <td width="220" align="left" valign="top">topical terms (X50)</td>

            <td valign="top" align="left">uniform titles with subject subdivisions (X30)</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </div>
   <p>A <strong>subject</strong> may be used only as a subject access entry. </p>
   <p>The term <strong>subject subdivision</strong> refers to: </p>
   <div class="table">
      <table width="615">
         <tr>
            <td height="24" align="left" valign="top">general subdivision terms (X80)</td>
            <td valign="top" align="left">geographic subdivision names (X81)</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td valign="top" align="left">chronological subdivision terms (X82)</td>
            <td valign="top" align="left">form subdivision terms (X85)</td>
         </tr>
      </table>
   </div>
   <p>A <strong>subject subdivision</strong> may be used <em>with</em> a name or subject lead element in an extended subject access entry. It may <em>not</em> be used as the lead element in a main, added, series, or subject access entry. </p>
   <p>The <em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</em> also provides for information concerning the authorized forms of <strong>node labels</strong>. A node label is not assigned to documents as an indexing term. </p>
   <p><strong>Kinds of Authority Records</strong></p>
   <p>MARC authority records are distinguished from all other types of MARC records by the presence of code z (Authority data) in Leader/06 (Type of record). The formulation of a name, subject, subject subdivision, or node label heading in an authority record is based on generally accepted cataloging and thesaurus-building conventions (e.g., <em>AACR 2</em>, <em>LCSH</em>). The content of the remainder of the authority records follows the practice of the organization creating the record. </p>
   <p>The <em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</em> identifies seven kinds of authority records in 008/09, (Kind of record): </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Established heading</strong> (code a) - An authority record in which field 100-155 contains an established name or subject. An established heading record may also contain tracing fields for variant and related headings and notes recording such information as the sources used to establish the heading and series treatment. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Subdivision</strong> (code d) - An authority record in which the 18X field contains the authorized form of a general, chronological, genre/form term, or a geographic name that may be used only as a subject subdivision portion of an established heading. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Established heading and subdivision</strong> (code f) - An authority record in which the 15X field contains an established name or subject that may also be used as a subject subdivision portion of another established heading. (An organization may choose instead to create separate records for the established name or subject heading and the subdivision.) </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Reference</strong> (code b or c) - An authority record in which field 100-155 contains an unestablished name or subject. A reference record also contains either field 260 (Complex See Reference&#8722;Subject), field 664 (Complex See Reference&#8722;Name), or field 666 (General Explanatory Reference&#8722;Name) to guide the user to the established form. Separate codes are defined in 008/09 for <strong>traced</strong> and <strong>untraced</strong> reference records. The distinction depends upon whether the heading in the 1XX field in the record is also given as a see from tracing in a 4XX field in another authority record. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Reference and subdivision</strong> (code g) - An authority record in which the 15X field contains an unestablished name or subject that may also be used as a subject subdivision portion of an established heading. (An organization may choose instead to create separate records for the reference and the subdivision.) </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Node label</strong> (code e) - An authority record in which field 150 contains an unestablished term that is the authorized form used in the systematic section of a thesaurus to indicate the logical basis on which a category has been divided. </li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Types of Headings</strong></p>
   <p>In a MARC authority record, a <strong>heading</strong> is the content of a 1XX, 4XX, or 5XX field that documents the form of heading used for indexing and retrieval or organizational purposes in a file. Two types of headings are defined in the authorities format: </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Established heading</strong> - A heading that is authorized for use in other MARC records as a main entry (1XX), added entry (700-730), or series added entry (440 or 800-830) field or as the lead element in a subject access (600-655; 654-657) field. In authority records, established headings are used in fields 100-155 (headings) and fields 500-555 (tracings) for established heading (008/09, Kind of record, code a or f) records. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Unestablished heading</strong> - A heading that is <em>not</em> authorized for use in other MARC records as the lead element of a main, added, series, or subject access field. An unestablished heading may be a reference to a variant form of the established heading, a form of the heading used only for authority file organizational purposes, or a subject subdivision that is authorized for use with an established heading in an extended subject heading. In authority records, unestablished headings are used in the 1XX (heading) and 4XX (tracing) fields of reference (008/09, code b or c), subdivision (code d), reference and subdivision (code g), and node label (code e) records. An unestablished heading may also be used in the 4XX fields of established heading (code a or f) records. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Headings may be <strong>names, name/title combinations, uniform titles, chronological terms, topical terms, genre/form terms, subdivisions, extended subject headings</strong>, or <strong>node labels</strong>. </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Name heading</strong> - A heading that is a personal, corporate, meeting, or jurisdiction (including geographic) name. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Name/title heading</strong> - heading&#8722;A heading consisting of both name and title portions. The name portion contains a personal, corporate, meeting, or jurisdiction name. The title portion contains the title by which an item or a series is identified for cataloging purposes and may be a uniform or conventional title, a title page title of a work, or a series title. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Uniform title heading</strong> - A heading consisting of the title by which an item or a series is identified for cataloging purposes when the title is not entered under a personal, corporate, meeting, or jurisdiction name in a name/title heading construction. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Chronological term heading</strong> - A heading consisting of a chronological subject term. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Topical term heading</strong> - A heading consisting of a topical subject term. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Genre/form term heading</strong> - A heading consisting of a genre/form subject term. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Subdivision heading</strong> - A heading consisting of a general (topical or language), form, geographic, or chronological subject subdivision term. An extended subdivision heading contains more than one subject subdivision term (subfields $v, $x, $y, and $z). </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Extended subject heading</strong> - A name, name/title, uniform title, topical term, or genre/form term heading that includes one or more general, form, geographic, or chronological subject subdivision terms (subfields $v, $x, $y, or $z). </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Node label heading</strong> - A heading consisting of a term used in the systematic section of a thesaurus to indicate the logical basis on which a category is divided. </li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Heading Usage in Authority Records</strong></p>
   <p>The <em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</em> identifies three categories of heading usage in records: <strong>main</strong> or <strong>added entry</strong> (008/14); <strong>subject added entry</strong> (008/15); and <strong>series added entry</strong> (008/16). Only established headings may be used as the lead element of access points in bibliographic records. Name, name/title, and uniform title established headings may be appropriately used as any one, two, or three of the 008/14-16 usage categories. Topical term and extended subject headings may be used only as subject added entries. Subdivision headings may be used only in extended subject heading added entries. </p>
   <p><strong>Heading Usage in Authority Structures</strong></p>
   <p>A heading may be categorized as being suitable for either a <strong>name</strong> or a <strong>subject authority structure</strong>. Name, name/title, and uniform title headings that are formulated using descriptive cataloging conventions (008/10) are suitable for a <strong>name authority structure</strong>. Established forms of these types of headings are used in established heading (008/09, code a) and established heading and subdivision records (code f); unestablished forms are used in reference records (code b or c). Certain note and tracing and reference fields in the format are used only in records for headings suitable for name authority structures. </p>
   <p>Name, name/title, uniform title, chronological, topical and genre/form term (and extended subject headings using these types of headings), and subdivision headings that are formulated using subject heading system/thesaurus building conventions (008/11) are suitable for a <strong>subject authority structure</strong>. Established forms of these types of headings are used in established heading (008/09, code a) and established heading and subdivision (code f) records; unestablished forms are used in subdivision (code d), reference (code b or c), reference and subdivision (code g), and node label (code e) records. Certain note and tracing and reference fields in the format are used only in records for headings suitable for subject authority structures. </p>
   <p><strong>Series Treatment Information</strong></p>
   <p>Authority records that contain a 1XX field that contains a uniform title or name/title heading for a series may also contain information concerning the treatment of that series should the heading be used in bibliographic records. The term <em>series</em> applies to the types of series identified in 008/12: monographic series, multipart items, series-like phrases, and titles of occasionally-analyzable serials. The data elements and fields that are used to record series treatment include three character positions in the 008 field; link, standard number, and call number fields in the 0XX range; and the series treatment information fields in the 64X range. </p>

   <p><strong>COMPONENTS OF AUTHORITY RECORDS</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Description of Record Parts</strong></p>
   <p>A MARC authority record consists of three main components: the <strong>Leader</strong>, the <strong>Directory</strong>, and the <strong>variable fields</strong>. The following information summarizes the structure of a separate MARC record. More detail is provided in <em><a href="http://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/">MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media</a></em>. </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Leader</strong> - Data elements that primarily provide information for the processing of the record. The data elements contain numbers or coded values and are identified by relative character position. The Leader is fixed in length at 24 character positions and is the first field of a MARC record. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Directory</strong> - A series of entries that contain the tag, length, and starting location of each variable field within a record. Each entry is 12 character positions in length. Directory entries for variable control fields appear first, sequenced by the field tag in increasing numerical order. Entries for variable data fields follow, arranged in ascending order according to the first character of the tag. The stored sequence of the variable data fields in a record does not necessarily correspond to the order of the corresponding Directory entries. Duplicate tags are distinguished only by the location of the respective fields within the record. The Directory ends with a field terminator character (ASCII 1E hex). </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Variable fields</strong> - The data in a MARC authority record is organized into <strong>variable fields</strong>, each identified by a three-character numeric tag that is stored in the Directory entry for the field. Each field ends with a field terminator character. The last variable field in a record ends with both a field terminator and a record terminator (ASCII 1D hex). There are two types of <strong>variable fields</strong>. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Variable control fields</strong> - The 00X fields. These fields are identified by a field tag in the Directory but they contain neither indicator positions nor subfield codes. The variable control fields are structurally different from the variable data fields. They may contain either a single data element or a series of fixed-length data elements identified by relative character position. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Variable data fields</strong> - The remaining variable fields defined in the format. In addition to being identified by a field tag in the Directory, variable data fields contain two <strong>indicator positions</strong> stored at the beginning of each field and a two-character <strong>subfield code</strong> preceding each data element within the field. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>The <strong>variable data fields</strong> are grouped into blocks according to the first character of the <strong>tag</strong>, which with some exceptions identifies the function of the data within the record. The type of information in the field is identified by the remainder of the tag. </p>

   <p>Within variable data fields, the following two kinds of content designation are used:</p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Indicator positions</strong> - The first two character positions in the variable data fields that contain values which interpret or supplement the data found in the field. Indicator values are interpreted independently, that is, meaning is not ascribed to the two indicators taken together. Indicator values may be a lowercase alphabetic or a numeric character. A blank (ASCII SPACE), represented in this document as a #, is used in an undefined indicator position. In a defined indicator position, a blank may be assigned a meaning, or may mean <em>no information provided</em>. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"><strong>Subfield codes</strong> - Two characters that distinguish the data elements within a field which require separate manipulation. A subfield code consists of a delimiter (ASCII 1F hex), represented in this document as a $, followed by a data element identifier. Data element identifiers may be a lowercase alphabetic or a numeric character. Subfield codes are defined independently for each field; however, parallel meanings are preserved whenever possible (e.g., in the 100, 400, and 600 Personal Name fields). Subfield codes are defined for purposes of identification, not arrangement. The order of subfields is generally specified by standards for the data content, such as the cataloging rules. </li>
   </ul>
   <p><strong>Multiscript Authority Records</strong></p>
   <p>A MARC authority record may contain <em>data</em> in multiple scripts. One script may be considered the primary script of the <em>data content</em> of the record, even though other scripts are also used for data content. (Note: ASCII is used for the structure elements of the record, with most coded data also specified within the ASCII range of characters). General models for multiscript data are described in <a href="ecadmulti.html">Appendix C</a>, along with several full record examples. </p>
   <p><strong>Field and Subfield Repeatability</strong></p>
   <p>Theoretically, all fields and subfields may be repeated. The nature of the data, however, often precludes repetition. For example, an authority record may contain only one 1XX field; a field 100 may contain only one subfield $a (Personal name) but may contain more than one subfield $c (Titles and other words associated with a name). The repeatability or non-repeatability of each field and subfield is specified in the format. </p>
   <p><strong>Field Linking</strong></p>
   <p>Fields in the record may be specially linked using a generally-applicable field linking technique. The technique relies upon the syntax of data in subfield $8 (Field link and sequence number) to identify the linked fields. The structure and syntax for the field link and sequence number subfield are described in <a href="ecadcntf.html">Appendix A</a>. </p>
   <p><strong>Fill Character and Related Values</strong></p>
   <p>A fill character (ASCII 7C hex), represented in this document as a vertical bar (|), may be used in authority records in field 008, and subfield $w of the 4XX and 5XX tracing and 700-785 linking entry fields. A fill character may not be used in the Leader, or in tags, indicators, or subfield codes. The use of the fill character in records contributed to a national database may also be dependent upon the national level requirements specified for each data element. The presence of a fill character in an authority record indicates that the format specifies a code to be used but the creator of the record has decided not to attempt to supply a code. </p>
   <p>Code u (Unknown or unspecified) when it is defined indicates that the creator of the record attempted to supply a code but was unable to determine what the appropriate code should be. </p>
   <p>Code n (Not applicable) is defined in many coded positions to indicate that the characteristic defined by the position is not applicable to a specific type of item or kind of record. </p>
   <p><strong>Display Constants</strong></p>
   <p>A display constant is a term, phrase, spacing, or punctuation convention that may be system generated under prescribed circumstances in order to make a visual presentation of data in a record more meaningful to a user. In the authority format certain field tags (e.g., field 770, Supplement/Special Issue Entry), indicators (e.g. the 4XX and 5XX tracing fields), and subfield codes (e.g., the subject subdivision subfields $v, $x, $y, and $z in an extended subject heading), and coded values (e.g., tracings control subfield $w/0, Special relationship) may be used to generate specific display constants. The use of display constants is determined by each organization or system. Examples of display constants are provided under <em>Input Conventions</em> in the field descriptions. </p>
   <p><strong>Record Content Responsibility</strong></p>
   <p>The <em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</em> serves as a vehicle for authority data of all types from any organization. In general, the responsibility for the data content, content designation, and transcription of authority data within a MARC record may be determined by examination of the field indicated in the <strong>responsible parties</strong> section below. The data content of certain data elements, however, is restricted when the element is an <strong>agency-assigned</strong> or a <strong>controlled-list</strong> data element. </p>
   <p><strong>Responsible Parties</strong></p>
   <p>In <em>unmodified records</em>, the organization identified as the original cataloging source in 008/39 and/or 040 $a is responsible for the content of the record. The organization identified as the transcribing agency in field 040 $c is responsible for the content designation and transcription of the data. </p>
   <p>In <em>modified records</em>, the organizations identified in 040 $a and $d (Modifying agency) are collectively responsible for the content of the record. Organizations identified as transcribing or modifying agencies in field 040 $c and $d are collectively responsible for the content designation and transcription of the data. </p>
   <p><strong>Agency-assigned Data Elements</strong></p>
   <p>An agency-assigned data element is one whose content is determined by a designated agency and is the responsibility of that agency, e.g., field 010 (Library of Congress Control Number). While it is usually input by the designated agency, it may be transcribed by another organization. </p>
   <p><strong>Controlled-list Data Elements</strong></p>
   <p>Certain data elements contain data from controlled lists maintained by designated agencies, e.g., the <em>MARC Code List for Geographic Areas</em> in field 043 (Geographic Area Code). These elements are indicated at the field or subfield level in MARC 21 and only values from the designated lists may be used. If a change or addition is desirable for a list, the maintenance agency for the list should be consulted. </p>
   <p><strong>Record Level Requirements</strong></p>
   <p>User groups may have full level and minimal level record requirements to promote consistency across cataloging agencies. These should be widely publicized for all possible interchange partners to be aware. </p>

   <p><strong>ORGANIZATION OF THIS DOCUMENT</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Main Parts</strong></p>
   <p><em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</em> consists of a Summary Statement of Content Designators followed by a detailed presentation of each content designator. Following the descriptions of the Leader and the Directory, the variable control fields are arranged in field tag order (001-008). The variable data fields are presented in the following groupings in order to bring together fields that serve related functions: </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet">Numbers and Codes</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Headings</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Tracings and References</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Series Treatment</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Notes</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Heading Linking Entries</li>
      <li class="nobullet">Alternate Graphics</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Appendixes to this document provide information about several control subfields (<a href="ecadcntf.html">Appendix A</a>), full level record examples (<a href="examples.html">Appendix B</a>), multiscript record examples (<a href="ecadmulti.html">Appendix C</a>), an alphabetical listing of ambiguous headings with suggested tagging (<a href="ambiguous-headings.html">Appendix D</a>), a multilingual list of initial definite and indefinite articles (<a href="adapndxe.html">Appendix E</a>), lists of changes to the format since the last edition or update (<a href="adapndxf.html">Appendix F</a>), and a list of organization code sources (<a href="ecadorg.html">Appendix G</a>). </p>
   <p><strong>General Information Sections</strong></p>
   <p>To avoid repetition, general information sections are provided for groups of fields with similar characteristics. These general information sections provide instructions for the content designators that are common to each field in the group. The description for each of the fields refers back to the general information section for that group and to any related general information section. </p>
   <p>To reduce repetition, the X-- <em>General Information</em> section is provided for types of headings (X00 Personal Names; X10 Corporate Names; X11 Meeting Names; X30 Uniform Titles, X48 Chronological Terms, X50 Topical Terms; X51 Geographic Names; X55 Genre/Form terms; X80 General Subdivisions; X81 Geographic Subdivisions; X82 Chronological Subdivisions; X85 Form Subdivisions). These general information sections provide instructions for the content designators that are common to each type of personal heading whether it is used in a 1XX heading, 4XX see from tracing or 5XX see also from tracing field, or a 7XX heading linking entry field. The description for each of the individual fields (i.e., 100, 600, 700, 800) refers back to the X-- <em>General Information</em> section for that type of heading. </p>
   <p>A <em>Tracing and Reference Fields&#8722;General Information</em> section describes the use of the tracing fields (4XX and 5XX fields) and the various reference note fields (field 260, 360, and fields 663-666) in constructing displays of cross references from these fields. It also provides instructions for applying subfield $i (Relationship information) and subfield $w (Control subfield) in the 4XX and 5XX fields. The description for each of the reference note fields contains the detailed instructions for the content designators for the field. Reference is made to the <em>Tracing and Reference Fields&#8722;General Information</em> section only for cross reference display descriptions. Descriptions for the 4XX and 5XX fields refer to both the related X-- <em>General Information</em> section and the Tracing and reference fields section for content designator instructions. </p>
   <p>A <em>7XX Heading Linking Entries&#8722;General Information</em> section describes the use of the linking fields and provides instructions for applying the second indicator (Subject heading system/thesaurus) and subfield $0 (Record control number), subfield $w (Control subfield), subfield $2 (Source of heading or term), and subfield $8 (Field Link and sequence number). The individual descriptions for fields 700-785 list all of the content designators for each field and refer to both the general information section for the corresponding type of heading and to the 7XX general information section for application guidelines. The first indicator position and all of the subfield codes for field 788 (Complex Linking Entry Data) are fully described in the field 788 description. </p>
   <p><strong>Components of the Detailed Descriptions</strong></p>
   <p>A detailed description may consist of six parts: content designator listing; character position or field definition and scope; guidelines for applying content designators, with examples; input conventions; and content designator history. </p>
   <p>The <strong>content designator listing</strong> area presents </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet">the name of the content designator</li>
      <li class="nobullet">the repeatability/nonrepeatability code (R or NR)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>For the Leader and the variable control fields, the list gives the <strong>name</strong> of the character position and any defined coded value. For the variable data fields, the list gives the name of the indicator positions and any defined coded values and the name of the subfield codes and any defined coded values. For all variable fields, the <strong>repeatability/nonrepeatability code</strong> at the field level specifies whether the field may be repeated in a record. For variable data fields, the subfield repeatability code specifies whether the subfield code may be repeated within a field. </p>
   <p>The <strong>character position or field definition and scope</strong> area describes the contents of the character position or field, the appropriateness of its use in specific kinds of authority records, and gives other information, such as field repeatability in particular circumstances, the use of required lists or rules in formulating the data, etc. </p>
   <p>The <strong>guidelines for applying content designators</strong> area describes the content and scope of each coded value, indicator, or subfield code and gives other information, such as appropriateness for use and repeatability in certain circumstances. Examples showing the use of the content designator are provided immediately following the description. The examples illustrate the application of specific MARC content designation. The data may be fuller or less full than would be used in actual cataloging practice. Most of the examples reflect the application of AACR 2 and ISBD; however, some reflect a generalized MARC application. Other examples illustrate specific points. In the X&#8211;General Information sections, the 1XX heading field examples usually illustrate the use of the content designators in a 4XX or 5XX tracing field as well. Neither field terminators nor record terminators are shown in the examples used in the <em>MARC 21 Format for Authority Data</em>. </p>
   <p>The <strong>input conventions</strong> area provides general guidance for the application of the content designators, and for such things as punctuation, spacing, and the use of display constants. The input conventions clarify MARC punctuation practices especially with respect to final punctuation. In the discussion of punctuation practices, <em>mark of punctuation</em> is a period (.), a question mark (?), an exclamation mark (!), or a hyphen (-). </p>
   <p>The <strong>content designator history</strong> area provides a record of significant content designator changes. The types of changes that are included are: </p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet">newly defined content designators that impact on coding consistency within a file </li>
      <li class="nobullet">redefined codes and values</li>
      <li class="nobullet">changes in codes and values for consistency across MARC specifications</li>
      <li class="nobullet">changes in repeatability when it impacts on file consistency</li>
      <li class="nobullet">restructuring</li>
      <li class="nobullet">obsolete content designation. Obsolete content designation formerly defined in only one format are designated <em>[USMARC only]</em> or <em>[CAN/MARC only]</em>; unmarked items were defined in both formats. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>In the MARC formats, a distinction is made between <strong>obsolete</strong> and <strong>deleted</strong> content designators. An <strong>obsolete</strong> content designator is one that may have been used in MARC records and that may continue to appear in records created prior to the date it was made obsolete. Obsolete content designators are not used in new records. An obsolete content designator is recorded in the <em>Content Designator History</em> area. Content designation instructions are provided for retrospective conversion of records having data elements that would have been identified by the obsolete content designator. A <strong>deleted</strong> content designator is not recorded in the history area and will no longer appear anywhere in the MARC documentation. A content designator that had been reserved in MARC but has not been defined, or one that had been defined but is known with near certainty not to have been used, may be deleted from the format. A deleted content designator is available for redefinition in a format. A deleted content designator is available for redefinition in a format. </p>
   <p><strong>Typographical Conventions</strong></p>
   <p>Throughout this document, the following typographical conventions are used:</p>
   <ul>
      <li class="nobullet">0 - The graphic 0 represents the digit zero in tags, fixed-position character positions, indicator positions, and other places numerics are used. This character must be distinguished from an uppercase letter O in examples or text. </li>
      <li class="nobullet"># - The graphic symbol # is used for a blank in coded fields and in other special situations where the existence of the character blank might be ambiguous. (In most textual examples, the blank is represented in the conventional way, by the absence of a character.) </li>
      <li class="nobullet">$ - The graphic symbol $ is used for the delimiter portion of a subfield code. Within the text, subfield codes are referred to as <em>subfield $a</em>, for example. </li>
      <li class="nobullet">/ - Specific character positions of the Leader, Directory, field 008, and subfield $w are expressed using a slash and the number of the character position, e.g., Leader/06, $w/0. </li>
      <li class="nobullet">1 - The graphic 1 represents the digit one (hex 31). This character must be distinguished from a lowercase roman alphabet letter l (hex 6C) and uppercase alphabetic letter I (hex 4C) in examples or text. </li>
      <li class="nobullet">| - The graphic | represents a fill character in MARC examples. When this mark appears in the left margin, it indicates areas of the text of this document where changes have been made. </li>
   </ul>
